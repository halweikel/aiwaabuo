I didn’t buy this game for the longest time because it was advertised as “co-op”/ multiplayer which to me meant that other RPG aspects of it would be dumbed down. Turns out I was completely wrong. Bought it on a whim a few weeks back for  and have been enjoying the heck out of it. The combat is great, there are a lot of interesting dialogue options, and many neat choices to make along the way as well. And the game is LONG. I thought I was near finishing it only to discover I was only about. Just started enhanced edition and I absolutely love it. How is the next one? How does it compare to this one? One other questions, so all shields block the same amount of damage? I got a shield that says 9% blocking chance. Does every shield block the same amount, but this one just has a 9% chance to actually work, or is it saying it blocks 9% of damage? How do I block. https://i.imgur.com/BO62LrW.png Playable with 4 xinput gamepads on one PC, tutorial on how to do this: Patch your game with this first: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=548760493 Then subscribe to this mod in the steam workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/app/373420/discussions/0/385429254944985201/ With those mods you can play up to four players online and LAN and create 4 heroes at the start. Next for 4 player local on one pc download this: https://drive.google.com/f. EDIT: Forgot to add that I play on PC and Switch I am not a very competitive player (unless it's fun competition instead of try-hard screaming) and would love to have a GamerPal that I could play cooperative games with. The GamerPal I am looking for isn't someone who races through games and who only focuses on the game itself. I don't mind getting serious to beat a game, but I would like to goof off at times or just chat. The opposite is also true, I don't want to ONLY chat but actually. Where can i download the steamworks for Divinity? I can't find it anywhere. Thanks in advance.

There are two conditions to this trade: - You must be able to accept a steam gift copy of the collector's edition of Divinity OS and gift back the extra copy it adds to your inventory. - You must not be in a region that has locks on their steam gifts, such as South America, SEA and Eastern Europe. With these mods you can actually open two instances of the game and play 4 players locally: https://steamcommunity.com/app/373420/discussions/0/1776010325117816632/ But the issue is the gamepads inputs and only the focused screen accepts input.

Or are there any tutorials I am offering Divinity OS EE in exchange for  paypal or for humble gift links, just as project cars 2 from the early unlocks.

After completing the game in 60+ hours, I have to say, I enjoyed this game, but, man, it has some frustrating things about it. Some of the quests in this game were annoying to complete. There are a few quality of life things from D:OS 2 that I definitely missed, like the inventory screen in D:OS 2 is so much easier to navigate and using bedrolls to heal your party made it so you didn't DOS1E is on sale right now, so I'm wondering if people would recommend I get that or I just dish out the extra money for DOS2D. Opinions? Thoughts. I decided to start over and follow the "best" build available, unfortunately I'm having a difficult time trying to decipher the guide, as the guide itself has a guide explaining the guide, it's just in a rather awful format. If anybody could help me decode it, I'd appreciate it. Here's the guide - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=607492091 I think I understand leveling the skills but I don't understand what skills to use, when should I get them and does the order matter.
